# Power_Plant_Turbine_Energy_Prediction
A combined cycle power plant comprises gas, steam turbines, and heat recovery steam generators.In this plant,electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines combined in one cycle.We have to model the energy generated as a function of exhaust vacuum and ambient variables and use that model to improve the plant's performance.
