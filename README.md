# ***Power_Plant_Turbine_Energy_Prediction***

A combined cycle power plant comprises gas, steam turbines, and heat recovery steam generators.In this plant,electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines combined in one cycle.We have to model the energy generated as a function of exhaust vacuum and ambient variables and use that model to improve the plant's performance.

The Dataset have five Columns.

1. Temperature
2. r_humidity
3. exhaust_vacuum
4. energy_production
5. amb_pressure

This is multilinear regression project where prediction is `energy_prediction` which is Dependant feature in this case.

## ***Exploratory Data Analysis***



## ***Feature Engineering and Feature Selection***

The features are classified into Dependant and Independant feature

### ***Train test split***

Dependant and Independant data partioned into train test set for model evaluation purpose

### ***Scalling of Data***


## ***Model Building***

By using sklearn Linear Regression Model is build For making predictions.

## ***Model validation***


## ***Model Evaluation***


## ***Deployment*** [app_link](https://gas-steam-turbine-energy-prediction.streamlit.app/)
By using Streamlit Framework we deploythe model on deveopment server
